# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game : Bryan Calcagno
This game is extended from the snake game version supplied in the starter repository at:  [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project I have extended the snake game to include a hazard in the form of a natural snake predator called a mongoose which the player must deftly avoid contacting as they manuver the snake to find food. As the snake increases in size and speed the difficulty in avoiding the mongoose increases. The mongoose is assumed to pop up out of its underground burrough at random locations every so often. If the snake and mongoose come into contact with each other by sharing a positional coordinate, the mongoose is assumed to attack the snake with a bite. The player's snake is allowed two bites before the snake is considered to lose its life.
